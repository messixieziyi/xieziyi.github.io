  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>New York University</strong>, M.S. in Data Science (2020 – 2022, GPA: 3.9/4.0)</li>
    <li><strong>University of California, Santa Barbara</strong>, B.S. Honor Program in Physics, College of Creative Studies, Summer Research Fellowship (2016 – 2020, GPA: 3.9/4.0)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <h3>Data Scientist and Developer @ Capital One (2024 - Present), McLean, VA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Engaged in revamping valuation model infrastructure, including data structures and Dask based distributed computing. Helped support the company vision of customized credit card approval.</li>
    <li>Refactored major valuation model to adopt the new infrastructure and lead validation efforts to extract and compare model results at different places in the process.</li>
    <li>Lead efforts on refactor and improve scenario analysis for valuation models. Worked with business and engineering stake holders to deliver faster and less ambiguous experience.</li>
    <li>Lead efforts on consolidating a central financial metrics calculation within Capital One across its use among different kinds of valuation models.</li>
    <li>Developed adequate understanding of credit card business and supported on-boarding of new teammates, and team planning of future direction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data Scientist @ Amazon (Summer 2021, 2022 – Present), Seattle, WA and New York City</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Published monthly forecast updates for Amazon EC2 Server Demand for various AWS Data Centers over the next 2+ years.</li>
    <li>Built customized Time-series Forecast Validation and Anomaly Detection mechanisms to automatically detect issues in forecast. Developed Automated Dashboards in QuickSight and Python scripts for Excel report automation, enhancing forecast visualization and snapshot-over-snapshot analysis. These reduced the duration of average human forecast review process to 1/3 of the original time frame.</li>
    <li>Enhanced algorithm of Amazon EC2 Server Demand forecast model by leveraging life cycle information of different generations of EC2 servers and optimize model structures, thereby improving the model accuracy by 15% with a yearly impact of $225 MM and reducing daily forecast run time from 2 hour to 30 min.</li>
    <li>Used data driven evidence to support AWS Data Center migration as a result of imminent capacity constraints. Recommended strategy to migrate AWS services on Marketplace Level from one Large AWS region to multiple new AWS regions based on projected demand and supply.</li>
    <li>Communicated with AWS to understand supply constraints and supply plan for EC2, and translate them into usable inputs for EC2 demand Forecast.</li>
    <li>Evaluated and published Peak Event (Prime Day, Black Friday, Cyber Monday) traffic, order rate, service throughput for scaling purposes starting six months prior and concluding with a final confirmation weeks before the event.</li>
    <li>Prototyped analytical models to optimize financial planning strategies, enhanced forecasting accuracy by 31% in Mean Average Percentage Error and 63% in total budget allocation with $1.26 B impact. Designed metrics for forecast evaluation to quantify model performance in the scope of financial planning with various emphasis. This advancement accelerated the automation of financial planning at Amazon, laying the groundwork for the present automated financial planning model currently being used.</li>
    <li>Article on Amazon Science for the work from my team: <em>How CloudTune generates forecasts for the Amazon Store</em> at Amazon Science Website (linked or search for title). This article discusses how we generate forecasts for traffic and load on Amazon services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Experience</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>@ University of Tokyo, Bio-engineering Department, 2018 Summer: We built a lab setup of a laser imaging system with a high energy pulse laser and a laser-excited acoustic wave generation mechanism. Applied image processing techniques to analyze the deformation of cancer cells under mechanical force from acoustic waves using laser imaging.</li>
    <li>@ UC Santa Barbara, Mechanical Engineering Department, 2017-2019: Designed and built silicon-made dual-micro-channel of different size and shapes, and injected two streams of constant flows of liquid with different fluorescence through the channel under electromagnetic microscope. Used Particle Image Velocimetry software (based on MATLAB) to analyze liquid flow in channels of various shapes, identifying designs that enhance mixing, as evidenced by density variation.</li>
  </ul>
